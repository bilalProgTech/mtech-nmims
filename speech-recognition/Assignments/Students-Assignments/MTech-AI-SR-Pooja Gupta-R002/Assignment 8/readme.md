## Next word prediction in Audio files

* The notebook helps in understanding how we can use mfcc features for predicting words in audio in an iterative manner to form the sentence representation of the audio files
* The approach is sim,ilar to image Captioning
* Here we usee mfcc features and pass them through a convolution network to create embeddings
