# Phoneme to Word Conversion

## Word Pronunciation: Classifying the Phonemes into Words
Phoneme: any of the perceptually distinct units of sound in a specified language that distinguish one word from another, for example p, b, d, and t in the English words pad, pat, bad, and bat

**Phonemes**
- The pronunciation of words or the phonemes of a word vary depending on different factors like dialect and accent of a person.
- Dialect is a particular form of a language which is peculiar to a specific region or social group.
- Accent is a distinctive way of pronouncing a language, especially one associated with a particular country.
- Both of these factors play an important role for determining how a word needs to be pronounced out loud.

We need to analyse the different components of phonemes for a given dialect region and identify the word corresponding to that phoneme
