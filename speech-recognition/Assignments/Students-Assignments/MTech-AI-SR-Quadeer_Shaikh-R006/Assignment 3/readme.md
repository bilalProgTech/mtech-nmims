# Dysarthria Classification using CNNs on Audio Files

## What is Dysarthria ?
- Weakness in the muscles used for speech, which often causes slowed or slurred speech.
- Dysarthria is a condition in which the part of your brain that controls your lips, tongue, vocal cords, and diaphragm doesn't work well. It's hard for you to move those muscles the right way. Itâ€™s often brought on by a disease.
- Some people with dysarthria have only minor speech problems. Others have so much trouble getting their words out that other people may not be able to understand them very well.
